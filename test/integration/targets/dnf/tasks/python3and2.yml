# INSTALLPYTHON3AND2
#  The module `dnf` installs python3-dnf on python3 systems and python2-dnf
#  on python2 systems. Fedora 30 and newer have python3 and limited
#  support for python2, for example python2-dnf is missing.
#  This test proves that python3 and python2 can be installed and the module
#  `dnf` works.
